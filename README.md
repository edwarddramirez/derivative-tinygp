# derivative-tinygp
Summary notebooks using derivative gaussian processes with tinygp. Unlike the tutorial, we implement a 2D derivative gaussian process and perform Bayesian inference using a 2D derivative gaussian process. If you want these features to be added to `tinygp`, feel free to notify me so I can request it.
