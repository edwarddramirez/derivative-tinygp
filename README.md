# derivative-tinygp
Summary notebooks using derivative gaussian processes with tinygp. Building from the `tinygp` tutorial on [Derivative Observations & Pytree Data][1], we implement a 2D derivative gaussian process, perform SVI with 1D derivative gaussian processes, and perform SVI using 2D derivative gaussian processes.
